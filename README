Support
=======
We use semantic version numbers for our releases, and recommend that users stay
as up-to-date as possible by upgrading to patch releases and minor releases as
they become available.

Bugfixes and ongoing development will occur in minor releases for the current
major version. Security fixes will be backported to a previous major version on
a best-effort basis, until the previous major version is no longer maintained.


For example: If a security vulnerability is discovered in Mcollective 2.5.3, we
would fix it in the 2 series, most likely as 2.5.4. Maintainers would then make
a best effort to backport that fix onto their latest supported release.

Long-term support, including security patches and bug fixes, is available for
commercial customers. Please see the following page for more details:
