ABOUT THIS FORK


This fork of mcollective aims to add ssh key authentication as the security
module rather than psk or ssl.

Requires rubygem 'sshkeyauth' (gem install sshkeyauth). That project lives here:
http://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-sshkeyauth

Configuration -

client.cfg:
securityprovider = sshkey

server.cfg:
securityprovider = sshkey
plugin.sshkey = /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

Requirements (these may change as code improves):

* Your client's username must exist on the remote server and must have an
  authorized_keys file.

* Your client must be running an ssh agent with keys loaded

* Your client must have the public key for all target hosts in your known_hosts
  file.
