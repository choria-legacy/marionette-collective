      # Codes 2 to 5 maps directly to UnknownRPCAction, MissingRPCData, InvalidRPCData and UnknownRPCError
      # see below for a description of those, in each case :statusmsg would be the reason for failure.

      #   rpc.echo(:msg => "hello world") do |resp|
      #      pp resp

      # UnknownRPCAction - There is no matching action on the agent
      # MissingRPCData - You did not supply all the needed parameters for the action
      # InvalidRPCData - The data you did supply did not pass validation
      # UnknownRPCError - Some other error prevented the agent from running

      # how many nodes were discovered, you can disable this by setting progress to false:
      #
      #   rpc.progress = false
      #
      # This supports a 2nd mode where it will send the SimpleRPC request and never handle the
