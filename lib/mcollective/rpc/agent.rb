module MCollective
  module RPC
    # A wrapper around the traditional agent, it takes care of a lot of the tedious setup
    # you would do for each agent allowing you to just create methods following a naming
    # standard leaving the heavy lifting up to this clas.
    #
    # See http://marionette-collective.org/simplerpc/agents.html
    #
    # It only really makes sense to use this with a Simple RPC client on the other end, basic
    # usage would be:
    #
    #    module MCollective
    #      module Agent
    #        class Helloworld<RPC::Agent
    #          action "hello" do
    #            reply[:msg] = "Hello #{request[:name]}"
    #          end
    #
    #          action "foo" do
    #            implemented_by "/some/script.sh"
    #          end
    #        end
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    # If you wish to implement the logic for an action using an external script use the
    # implemented_by method that will cause your script to be run with 2 arguments.
    #
    # The first argument is a file containing JSON with the request and the 2nd argument
    # is where the script should save its output as a JSON hash.
    #
    # We also currently have the validation code in here, this will be moved to plugins soon.
