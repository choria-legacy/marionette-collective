  #   cwd         - the working directory the command will be run from
  #   stdin       - a string that will be sent to stdin of the program
  #   stdout      - a variable that will receive stdout, must support <<

  #   environment - the shell environment, defaults to include LC_ALL=C
  #                 set to nil to clear the environment even of LC_ALL
