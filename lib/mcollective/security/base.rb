module MCollective
  module Security
    # This is a base class the other security modules should inherit from
    # it handles statistics and validation of messages that should in most
    # cases apply to all security models.
    #
    # To create your own security plugin you should provide a plugin that inherits
    # from this and provides the following methods:
    #
    # decodemsg      - Decodes a message that was received from the middleware
    # encodereply    - Encodes a reply message to a previous request message
    # encoderequest  - Encodes a new request message
    # validrequest?  - Validates a request received from the middleware
    #
    # Optionally if you are identifying users by some other means like certificate name
    # you can provide your own callerid method that can provide the rest of the system
    # with an id, and you would see this id being usable in SimpleRPC authorization methods
    #
    # The @initiated_by variable will be set to either :client or :node depending on
    # who is using this plugin.  This is to help security providers that operate in an
    # asymetric mode like public/private key based systems.
    #
    # Specifics of each of these are a bit fluid and the interfaces for this is not
    # set in stone yet, specifically the encode methods will be provided with a helper
    # that takes care of encoding the core requirements.  The best place to see how security
    # works is by looking at the provided MCollective::Security::PSK plugin.
