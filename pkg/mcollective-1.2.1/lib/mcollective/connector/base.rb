module MCollective
    # Connector plugins handle the communications with the middleware, you can provide your own to speak
    # to something other than Stomp, your plugins must inherit from MCollective::Connector::Base and should
    # provide the following methods:
    #
    # connect       - Creates a connection to the middleware, no arguments should get its parameters from the config
    # receive       - Receive data from the middleware, should act like a blocking call only returning if/when data
    #                 was received.  It should get data from all subscribed channels/topics.  Individual messages
    #                 should be returned as MCollective::Request objects with the payload provided
    # send          - Takes a target and msg, should send the message to the supplied target topic or destination
    # subscribe     - Adds a subscription to a specific message source
    # unsubscribe   - Removes a subscription to a specific message source
    # disconnect    - Disconnects from the middleware
    #
    # These methods are all that's needed for a new connector protocol and should hopefully be simple
    # enough to not have tied us to Stomp.
