    # Registration is implimented using a module structure and installations can
    # configure which module they want to use.
    #
    # We provide a simple one that just sends back the list of current known agents
    # in MCollective::Registration::Agentlist, you can create your own:
    #
    # Create a module in plugins/mcollective/registration/<yourplugin>.rb
    #
    # You can inherit from MCollective::Registration::Base in which case you just need
    # to supply a _body_ method, whatever this method returns will be send to the
    # middleware connection for an agent called _registration_
    module Registration
        autoload :Base, "mcollective/registration/base"
