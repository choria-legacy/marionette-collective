    # At present there are assumptions about the naming of topics and queues that is
    # compatible with Stomp, ie.
    #
    # /topic/foo.bar/baz
    # /queue/foo.bar/baz
    #
    # This is the only naming format that is supported, but you could replace Stomp
    # with something else that supports the above, see MCollective::Connector::Stomp
    # for the default connector.
