3 ActiveMQ servers clustered together in a star foramt:


      broker2 <-----> broker1 <----> broker3


Pay attention to the names in the config file as well 
as the users.  This is identical to the simple single
broker example except with the aded amq user for the 
clustering and the connection setups in broker1

Tested to work with ActiveMQ 5.3.0
