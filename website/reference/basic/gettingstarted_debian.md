Getting started using Debian based distribution like Debian squeeze and Ubuntu is easy as DEBs are available for most the required components.  This guide walks you through the process.

## Requirements
We try to keep the requirements on external Gems to a minimum, you only need:

 * A Stomp server, tested against [ActiveMQ][]
 * Ruby
 * RubyGems
 * [Ruby Stomp Client][Stomp]

## Packages

We strongly recommend you set up a local Apt repository that will host all the packages on your LAN, you can get the prerequisite packages here:

 * [ActiveMQ][]
 * Java - OpenJDK that is included with your distribution
 * Ruby - included with your distribution
 * [RubyGems][]
 * Stomp Ruby Gem
 * [MCollective][MCDownloads] - mcollective-2.2.x-1_all.deb, mcollective-common-2.2.x-1_all.deb, mcollective-client-2.2.x-1_all.deb

The rest of this guide will assume you set up a Apt repository.  Puppet Labs hosts a Apt repository with all these dependencies at _apt.puppetlabs.com_.

## ActiveMQ

ActiveMQ is currently the most used and tested middleware for use with MCollective.

You need at least one ActiveMQ server on your network, all the nodes you wish to manage will connect to the central ActiveMQ server.
Later on you can [cluster the ActiveMQ servers for availability and scale][ActiveMQClustering].

### Install

On the server that you chose to configure as the ActiveMQ server:

{% highlight console %}
% apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
{% endhighlight %}

ActiveMQ installation instructions can be found [here][ActiveMQ Getting Started].

### Configuring

[The ActiveMQ config reference][activemq_config] describes all of the ActiveMQ settings that MCollective cares about. For best use, skim the sections you care about while comparing it to an example activemq.xml file.

[activemq_config]: /mcollective/deploy/middleware/activemq.html

We recommend that new users:

* Start with the [single-broker example config][ActiveMQSingleBrokerSample].
* Change the [user account passwords](/mcollective/deploy/middleware/activemq.html#authentication-users-and-groups).
* [Set up TLS](/mcollective/deploy/middleware/activemq.html#tls-credentials) and [use a TLS Stomp transport connector](/mcollective/deploy/middleware/activemq.html#transport-connectors).

Other example config files are also available from [GitHub][ActiveMQSamples].

### Starting

Start the ActiveMQ service:

{% highlight console %}
  # /etc/init.d/activemq start
{% endhighlight %}

You should see it running in the process list:

{% highlight console %}
 # ps auxw|grep java
 activemq  3012  0.1 14.5 1155112 152180 ?      Sl   Dec28   2:02 java -Dactivemq.home=/usr/share/activemq -Dactivemq.base=/usr/share/activemq -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dorg.apache.activemq.UseDedicatedTaskRunner=true -Xmx512m -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib:/usr/lib64 -classpath /usr/share/java/tanukiwrapper.jar:/usr/share/activemq/bin/run.jar -Dwrapper.key=eg4_VvENzCmvtAKg -Dwrapper.port=32000 -Dwrapper.jvm.port.min=31000 -Dwrapper.jvm.port.max=31999 -Dwrapper.pid=3000 -Dwrapper.version=3.2.3 -Dwrapper.native_library=wrapper -Dwrapper.service=TRUE -Dwrapper.cpu.timeout=10 -Dwrapper.jvmid=1 org.tanukisoftware.wrapper.WrapperSimpleApp org.apache.activemq.console.Main start
{% endhighlight %}

You should also see it listening on port 61613 or 61614 in your network stack, depending on whether you turned on TLS.

You should open port 61613 or 61614 for all your nodes to connect to.

## Marionette Collective

There are a few packages supplied and you will have potentially two type of server:

 * Nodes that you wish to manage using mcollective need the mcollective and mcollective-common packages
 * Nodes that you wish to use to initiate requests from also known as clients need mcollective-client and mcollective-common packages

A machine can be both at once, in which case you need to install all 3 packages.  We'll work on the assumption here that you wish to both manage your machine and use it as a client by installing all 3 packages on our initial node.

### Installation

{% highlight console %}
  # apt-get install mcollective mcollective-client mcollective-common
  # gem install stomp
{% endhighlight %}


## Configuring
You'll need to tweak some configs in */etc/puppetlabs/agent/mcollective/client.cfg*, a full reference of config settings can be
found [here][ConfigurationReference]:

We're assuming you called the machine running ActiveMQ *stomp.example.net*; please change as appropriate. Also note that the port should be 61614 if you turned on TLS.

{% highlight ini %}
  # main config
  libdir = /usr/libexec/mcollective
  logfile = /dev/null
  loglevel = error

  # connector plugin config
  connector = activemq
  plugin.activemq.pool.size = 1
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.host = stomp.example.net
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.port = 61613
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.user = mcollective
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.password = marionette

  # security plugin config
  securityprovider = psk
  plugin.psk = abcdefghj
{% endhighlight %}

You should also create _/etc/puppetlabs/agent/mcollective/server.cfg_ here's a sample, a full reference of config settings can be found on the [Server Configuration Reference][server_config]:

{% highlight ini %}
  # main config
  libdir = /usr/libexec/mcollective
  logfile = /var/log/mcollective.log
  daemonize = 1
  loglevel = info

  # connector plugin config
  connector = activemq
  plugin.activemq.pool.size = 1
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.host = stomp.example.net
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.port = 61613
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.user = mcollective
  plugin.activemq.pool.1.password = marionette


  # facts
  factsource = yaml
  plugin.yaml = /etc/puppetlabs/agent/mcollective/facts.yaml

  # security plugin config
  securityprovider = psk
  plugin.psk = abcdefghj
{% endhighlight %}

Replace the *plugin.psk* in both these files with a Pre-Shared Key of your own.

### Create Facts
By default - and for this setup - we'll use a simple YAML file for a fact source, later on you can use Puppet Labs Facter or something else.

Create */etc/puppetlabs/agent/mcollective/facts.yaml* along these lines:

{% highlight yaml %}
  ---
  location: devel
  country: uk
{% endhighlight %}

### Start the Server

The packages include standard init script, just start the server:

{% highlight console %}
  # /etc/init.d/mcollective restart
{% endhighlight %}

You should see in the log file somethig like:

{% highlight console %}
  # tail /var/log/mcollective.log
  I, [2010-12-29T11:15:32.321744 #11479]  INFO -- : mcollectived:33 The Marionette Collective 1.1.0 started logging at info level
{% endhighlight %}

### Test connectivity

If all is fine and you see this log message you can test with the client code:

{% highlight console %}
% mco ping
your.domain.com                           time=74.41 ms

---- ping statistics ----
1 replies max: 74.41 min: 74.41 avg: 74.41
{% endhighlight %}

This sends out a simple 'hello' packet to all the machines, as we only installed one you should have just one reply.

If you install the _mcollective_ and _mcollective-common_ packages along wit the facts and server.cfg you should see more nodes show up here.

You can explore other aspects of your machines:

{% highlight console %}
% mco find --with-fact country=uk
your.domain.com
{% endhighlight %}

This searches all systems currently active for ones with a fact *country=uk*, it got the data from the yaml file you made earlier.

If you use confiuration management tools like puppet and the nodes are setup with classes with *classes.txt* in */var/lib/puppet* then you
can search for nodes with a specific class on them - the locations will configurable soon:

{% highlight console %}
% mco find --with-class common::linux
your.domain.com
{% endhighlight %}

The filter commands are important they will be the main tool you use to target only parts of your infrastructure with calls to agents.

See the `--help` option to the various `mco *` commands for available options.  You can now look at some of the available plugins and
play around, you might need to run the server process as root if you want to play with services etc.

### Plugins
We provide limited default plugins, you can look on our sister project [MCollective Plugins][Plugins] where you will
find various plugins to manage packages, services etc.

### Further Reading
From here you should look at the rest of the wiki pages some key pages are:
