# {{page.title}}

The stomp connector uses the [STOMP] rubygem to connect to compatible servers.  This is known to work with ActiveMQ and Stompserver.  Anecdotal evidence suggests it works with RabbitMQ's Stomp plugin.

This code will only work with version _1.1_ and _1.1.6_ or newer of the Stomp gem, the in between versions have threading issues.


## Configuring
### Common Options
The most basic configuration method is supported in all versions of the gem:

{% highlight ini %}
connector = stomp
plugin.stomp.host = stomp.my.net
plugin.stomp.port = 6163
plugin.stomp.user = me
plugin.stomp.password = secret
{% endhighlight %}

You can override all of these settings using environment variables STOMP_SERVER, STOMP_PORT, STOMP_USER, STOMP_PASSWORD.  It is recommended that your _client.cfg_ do not have usernames and passwords in it, users should set their own in the environment.

### Failover Pools
Newer versions of the Stomp gem supports failover between multiple Stomp servers, you need at least _1.1.6_ to use this.

{% highlight ini %}
connector = stomp
plugin.stomp.pool.size = 2
plugin.stomp.pool.host1 = stomp1
plugin.stomp.pool.port1 = 6163
plugin.stomp.pool.user1 = me
plugin.stomp.pool.password1 = secret

plugin.stomp.pool.host2 = stomp2
plugin.stomp.pool.port1 = 6163
plugin.stomp.pool.user1 = me
plugin.stomp.pool.password1 = secret
{% endhighlight %}

This gives it 2 servers to attempt to connect to, if the first one fails it will use the second.  As before usernames and passwords can be set with STOMP_USER, STOMP_PASSWORD.

If you do not specify a port it will default to _6163_

When using pools you can also specify the following options, these are the defaults in the Stomp 1.1.6 gem:

{% highlight ini %}
plugin.stomp.pool.initial_reconnect_delay = 0.01
plugin.stomp.pool.max_reconnect_delay = 30.0
plugin.stomp.pool.use_exponential_back_off = true
plugin.stomp.pool.back_off_multiplier = 2
plugin.stomp.pool.max_reconnect_attempts = 0
plugin.stomp.pool.randomize = false
plugin.stomp.pool.timeout = -1
{% endhighlight %}
