## Overview
The Marionette Collective 1.1.1 and newer supports a single executable - called
mco - and have a plugin type called application that lets you create
applications for this single executable.

In the past we tended to write small standalone scripts to interact with
MCollective, this had a number of issues:

 * Large number of executables in _/usr/sbin_
 * Applications behave inconsistently with regard to error handling and reporting
 * Discovering new applications is difficult since they are all over the filesystem
 * Installation and packaging of plugins is complex

We've attempted to address these concerns by creating a single point of access
for all applications - the _mco_ script - with unified help, error reporting and
option parsing.

Below you can see the single executable system in use:

{% highlight console %}

Known commands:

These applications are equivalent to the old mc-rpc and similar applications but without the problem of lots of files in _/usr/sbin_.

## Basic Application
Applications goes in _libdir/mcollective/application/echo.rb_, the one below is a simple application that speaks to a hypothetical _echo_ action of a _helloworld_ agent. This agent has been demonstrated in : writing [agents][SimpleRPCAgents].

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   description "Reports on usage for a specific fact"

   option :message,
          :description    => "Message to send",
          :arguments      => ["-m", "--message MESSAGE"],
          :type           => String,
          :required       => true

   def main
      mc = rpcclient("helloworld")

      printrpc mc.echo(:msg => configuration[:message], :options => options)

      printrpcstats
   end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here's the application we wrote in action:

{% highlight console %}
$ mco echo
The message option is mandatory

Please run with --help for detailed help
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight console %}
$ mco echo -m test

Most of the techniques documented in SimpleRPC [Clients] can be reused here, we've just simplified a lot of the common used patterns like CLI arguments and incorporated it all in a single framework.

## Reference

### Usage Messages

To add custom usage messages to your application we can add lines like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   description "Reports on usage for a specific fact"

   usage "mco echo [options] --message message"
end
{% endhighlight %}

You can add several of these messages by just adding multiple such lines.

### Application Options

A standard options hash is available simply as options you can manipulate it and pass it into the RPC Client like normal. See the SimpleRPC [Clients] reference for more on this.

### CLI Argument Parsing

There are several options available to assist in parsing CLI arguments. The most basic option is:

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   option :message,
          :description    => "Message to send",
          :arguments      => ["-m", "--message MESSAGE"]
end
{% endhighlight %}

In this case if the user used either `-m message` or `--message message` on the CLI the desired message would be in `configuration[:message]`

#### Required Arguments
You can require that a certain parameter is always passed:

{% highlight ruby %}
option :message,
  :description    => "Message to send",
  :arguments      => ["-m", "--message MESSAGE"],
  :required       => true
{% endhighlight %}

#### Argument data types
CLI arguments can be forced to a specific type, we also have some additional special types that the default ruby option parser cant handle on its own.

You can force data to be of type String, Fixnum etc:

{% highlight ruby %}
option :count,
  :description    => "Count",
  :arguments      => ["--count MESSAGE"],
  :type           => Fixnum
{% endhighlight %}

You can force an argument to be boolean:

{% highlight ruby %}
option :detail,
  :description    => "Detailed view",
  :arguments      => ["--detail"],
  :type           => :bool
{% endhighlight %}

If you have an argument that can be called many times you can force that to build an array:

{% highlight ruby %}
option :args,
  :description    => "Arguments",
  :arguments      => ["--argument ARG"],
  :type           => :array
{% endhighlight %}

Here if you supplied multiple arguments `configuration[:args]` will be an array with all the options supplied.

#### Argument validation
You can validate input passed on the CLI:

{% highlight ruby %}
option :count,
  :description    => "Count",
  :arguments      => ["--count MESSAGE"],
  :type           => Fixnum,
  :validate       => Proc.new {|val| val < 10 ? true : "The message count has to be below 10" }
{% endhighlight %}

Should the supplied value be 10 or more a error message will be displayed.

#### Disabling standard sections of arguments
By default every Application get all the RPC options enabling filtering, discovery etc.  In some cases this is undesirable so we let users disable those.

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   exclude_argument_sections "common", "filter", "rpc"
end
{% endhighlight %}

This application will only have --help, --verbose and --config as options, all the other options will be removed.

#### Post argument parsing hook
Right after all arguments are parsed you can have a hook in your program called, this hook could perhaps parse the remaining data on _ARGV_ after option parsing is complete.

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   description "Reports on usage for a specific fact"

   def post_option_parser(configuration)
      unless ARGV.empty?
         configuration[:message] = ARGV.shift
      else
         STDERR.puts "Please specify a message on the command line"
         exit 1
      end
   end

   def main
      # use configuration[:message] here to access the message
   end
end
{% endhighlight %}

#### Validating configuration
After the options are parsed and the post hook is called you can validate the contents of the configuration:

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   description "Reports on usage for a specific fact"

   # parse the first argument as a message
   def post_option_parser(configuration)
      configuration[:message] = ARGV.shift unless ARGV.empty?
   end

   # stop the application if we didnt receive a message
   def validate_configuration(configuration)
      raise "Need to supply a message on the command line" unless configuration.include?(:message)
   end

   def main
      # use configuration[:message] here to access the message
   end
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Exiting your application
You can use the normal _exit_ Ruby method at any time to exit your application and you can supply any
exit code as normal.

The supplied applications have a standard exit code convention, if you want your applications to exhibit
the same behavior use the _halt_ helper.  The exit codes are below:

|Code|Description                                          |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------|
|0   |Nodes were discovered and all passed                 |
|0   |No discovery was done but responses were received    |
|1   |No nodes were discovered                             |
|2   |Nodes were discovered but some responses failed      |
|3   |Nodes were discovered but no responses were received |
|4   |No discovery were done and no responses were received|

{% highlight ruby %}
class MCollective::Application::Echo<MCollective::Application
   description "Reports on usage for a specific fact"

   def main
      mc = rpcclient("echo")

      printrpc mc.echo(:msg => "Hello World", :options => options)

      printrpcstats

      halt mc.stats
   end
end
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see you pass the _halt_ helper an instance of the RPC Client statistics and it will then
use that to do the right exit code.
