# {{page.title}}
The Marionette Collective is a framework to build server
orchestration or parallel job execution systems.

> **Deprecation Note:** As of Puppet agent 5.5.4, MCollective is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Puppet agent. If you use MCollective with Puppet Enterprise, consider [moving from MCollective to Puppet orchestrator](/docs/pe/2018.1/migrating_from_mcollective_to_orchestrator.html). If you use MCollective with open source Puppet, consider migrating MCollective agents and filters using tools like [Bolt](/docs/bolt/) and PuppetDB's [Puppet Query Language](/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/query/tutorial-pql.html).

Primarily we'll use it as a means of programmatic execution of Systems Administration
actions on clusters of servers.  In this regard we operate in the same space as tools
like [Func], [Fabric] or [Capistrano].

We've attempted to think out of the box a bit designing this system by not relying on
central inventories and tools like SSH, we're not simply a fancy SSH "for loop".  MCollective use modern tools like
[Publish Subscribe Middleware] and modern philosophies like real time discovery of network resources using meta data
and not hostnames.  Delivering a very scalable and very fast parallel execution environment.

To get an immediate feel for what I am on about you can look at some of the videos on the
[Screencasts] page and then keep reading below for further info and links.  We've also created an [Amazon EC2 based demo]
where you can launch as many instances as you want to see how it behaves first hand.

## What is MCollective and what does it allow you to do

 * Interact with small to very large clusters of servers
 * Use a [broadcast paradigm] for request distribution.  All servers get all requests at the same time, requests have
   filters attached and only servers matching the filter will act on requests.  There is no central asset database to
   go out of sync, the network is the only source of truth.
 * Break free from ever more complex naming conventions for hostnames as a means of identity.  Use a very
   rich set of meta data provided by each machine to address them.  Meta data comes from
   [Puppet][UsingWithPuppet], [Chef][UsingWithChef], [Facter], [Ohai] or [plugins][WritingFactsPlugins] you provide yourself.
 * Comes with simple to use command line tools to call remote agents.
 * Ability to write [custom reports][NodeReports] about your infrastructure.
 * A number of agents to manage packages, services and other common components are [available from
   the community][PluginsSite].
 * Allows you to write [simple RPC style agents, clients][SimpleRPCIntroduction] and Web UIs in an easy to understand language - Ruby
 * Extremely pluggable and adaptable to local needs
 * Middleware systems already have rich [authentication and authorization models][SecurityWithActiveMQ], leverage these as a first
   line of control.  Include fine grained Authentication using [SSL][SSLSecurityPlugin] or [RSA][AESSecurityPlugin], [Authorization][SimpleRPCAuthorization] and
   [Auditing][SimpleRPCAuditing] of requests.  You can see more details in the [Security Overview][SecurityOverview].
 * Re-use the ability of middleware to do [clustering, routing and network isolation][ActiveMQClusters]
   to realize secure and scalable setups.

## Pluggable Core
We aim to provide a stable core framework that allows you to build it out into a system that meets
your own needs, we are pluggable in the following areas:

 * Replace our choice of middleware - STOMP compliant middleware - with your own like AMQP based.
 * Replace our authorization system with one that suits your local needs
 * Replace our serialization - Ruby Marshal and YAML based - with your own like [JSONSchema] that is cross language.
 * Add sources of data, we support [Chef][UsingWithChef] and [Puppet][UsingWithPuppet].   You can
   [provide a plugin to give us access to your tools data][WritingFactsPlugins].
   The community have ones for [Facter and Ohai already][PluginsSite]
 * Create a central inventory of services [leveraging MCollective as transport][Registration]
   that can run and distribute inventory data on a regular basis.
